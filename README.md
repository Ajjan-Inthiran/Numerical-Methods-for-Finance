    "# Numerical Methods for Finance\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository presents a curated collection of numerical techniques widely used in quantitative finance, implemented and visualized in Python.  \n",
    "Each notebook demonstrates a core mathematical method applied to derivative pricing, stochastic simulation, or partial differential equation (PDE) modeling, emphasizing accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency. The objective is to bridge theoretical finance with practical implementation to model price dynamics and evaluate complex instruments.\n",
